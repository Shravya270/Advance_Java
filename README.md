🌟 Advanced Java Programming Lab Guide
Welcome to the Advanced Java Lab, a hands-on journey through Java’s powerful features! This guide walks you through everything you’ll practice—from real-world data structures to web-based Java apps using JDBC, Servlets, and JSP.

🧰 Java Collections Mastery
🔹 Core Collections
ArrayList & LinkedList

Perform: Add, Update, Delete, Search

Sort data and extract sublists

Clear entire list contents

📘 Mini Projects & Exercises
ArrayList Tasks
✔️ Find specific elements (e.g., colors)
✔️ Remove by value or index
✔️ Sort alphabetically
✔️ Extract a portion of the list

LinkedList Tasks
🔁 Forward & reverse iteration
↪️ Insert at specific positions
🔄 Swap elements
🆔 Display items with their indices

✂️ String Handling & Manipulation
🧪 Core Concepts
Create, compare, extract substrings

Modify, format, and validate strings (like email)

⚙️ Practical String Utilities
Performance Test: StringBuffer vs StringBuilder

Tasks:

Null or empty check

Count word/substring frequency

Reverse a string

Palindrome checker

Remove whitespace

Title-case conversion

Character limit truncation

Digit-only validation

Generate random strings

🖼️ GUI Programming using Swing
🖥️ Swing Basics
Create interfaces with labels, buttons, and styled messages

🎯 Event-Based UI
Respond to button actions with messages & images

Dynamic content switching using JTabbedPane, JList

🌍 Web Development using Java EE
☕ Servlets
Input-based logic:
➤ Factorial calculator
➤ Prime number tester

Session management & cookies:
➤ Set and expire sessions/cookies

📄 JSP (JavaServer Pages)
Build dynamic web pages

Handle sessions and cookies

View cookie data in a readable format

🛢️ JDBC (Java + SQL Integration)
💼 Real-Time DB Operations
Build CRUD apps (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for:

Employee Database

Coffee Database

📋 Integration with Web
Link HTML forms with JSP pages

Display structured reports dynamically

Support filtering, deletion, and sorting from the browser

🧪 Setup Instructions
✅ Install XAMPP
Launch Apache & MySQL
Access DB at: http://localhost/phpmyadmin

🗂️ Import Databases
Use .sql files like employee.sql or test.sql to create tables

🚀 Configure Tomcat Server
Download and set up Apache Tomcat
Deploy your Servlets & JSP files

🧩 Add JDBC Driver
Include MySQL Connector/J in your project’s library path
